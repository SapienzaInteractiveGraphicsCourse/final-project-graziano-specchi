FARM DEFENDER
Interactive Graphics Project
Student : Graziano Specchi

0 - Introduction:     
The aim of this project is to create a 3D game through the “​ three.js​ ”
library, one of the most popular Javascript libraries for displaying 3D
content on the web. The player is in first person, so he can move on the
field and can also jump. He is in a farm and he has a stick in his right
hand. In the scene there are a windmill, a well, some trees, a square
fence containing dogs, and there are foxes arriving from all the 4 sides
of the fence trying to enter it and to eat the food of the dogs ( a cooked
chicken ). The aim of the player is to scare the foxes by playing the stick
in order to avoid them entering the fence.
